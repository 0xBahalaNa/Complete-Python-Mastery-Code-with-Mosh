13. Machine Learning with Python, 09. Calculating the Accuracy

Measure the accuracy of the models.
Split the data into training and testing. 
70-80% for training, the remaining 10-20% for testing.
Compare the predictions of the training set to the testing set. 
More complex the problem, the more data the model needs.
